My Dotfiles
===========

These are my personal dotfiles. They are managed using [homesick][1].

The ~/.brew file contains all my [homebrew packages][2].

## Git-hooks

You might also find the git_hooks interesting. They: 

* [Prevent me from force pushing to master][3]
* [Take a picture of myself on every commit][4]

## There's more

There are quite a lot of [other people][5], who have fare more interesting dotfiles than me.

## Contribute

If you find that I do something wrong or that I am missing out on something - send me a pull request.

I might not merge it - but I will be grateful for the inspiration ;)
